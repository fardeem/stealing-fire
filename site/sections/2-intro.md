STEALING FIRE is a workshop about accidental prometheans - participants in math and science olympiads who are using unconventional learning strategies, techniques in neuroscience and psychology to supercharge their learning and accomplish what used to take years in a matter of months.

We believe that the human potential is nearly limitless but having potential is the not the same as doing something with it. STEALING FIRE is about teaching you the tools, stratgeries and people you need to unleash the fullest of your academic potential and join the ranks of Prometheans. And unlike Prometheus himself, you can actually get away with it.
