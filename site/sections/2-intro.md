**Stealing Fire** is a workshop about accidental prometheans - participants in math and science olympiads who are using unconventional learning strategies, techniques in neuroscience and psychology to supercharge their learning and accomplish what used to take years in a matter of months. For the first time, the kimono is being opened to share those strategies with everyone.

We believe that the human potential is nearly limitless but having potential is not the same as doing something with it. In this workshop we will introduce to you the tools, strategies and people you need to know to unleash your academic potential and join the ranks of this new breed of Prometheans. And unlike Prometheus himself, you can actually get away with it.
