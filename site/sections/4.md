We have all been there. We are looking at the page, reading it for the 100th time with absolutely no clue what’s going on and feeling miserable. You’re trying so hard yet you can’t make sense of anything. On top of that, whenever you seem to complain, someone invariably says “just try harder”.

We don’t believe in “trying harder”. We believe in strategies and tactics and scientically proven ways to supercharge your learning. School always tells us WHAT to learn but never HOW to learn. It’s time we change all that.

At Stealing Fire, you will learn:

- The latest research in neuroscience and psychology that will help you learn much better than before and much faster than before.
- Simple exercises to make you feel present and alert on demand when you’re feeling lazy or anxious
- Tools to help manage exam stress and conquer self doubt
- Speed reading so that you can read an entire book in a day if you wanted to
- The 2500 year old technique to memorize anything with a snap of a finger
