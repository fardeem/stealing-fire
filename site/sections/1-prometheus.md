In Greek mythology, Prometheus was the original upstart rebel, who stole fire from the gods and shared it with humankind. He didnâ€™t just steal a book of matches, but also the power to seed civilisation: language, art, medicine, and technology. Enraged that mortals would now have the same power as the gods, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock, letting eagles rip out his innards for eternity.

This story has continued to repeat itself throughout the ages. Typically, a rebel, seeker, or trickster, steals fire from the gods. It can take the form of a potent celebratory rite, a heretical new scripture, an obscure spiritual practice, or a secret, state-changing technology. Whatever the case, the rebels sneak the flame out of the temple and share it with the world. It works. Things get exciting. Insights pile up. Then, inevitably, the party gets out of hand. The keepers of law and order - call them the priests - spot the hedonistic blaze, track down the thief, and shut down the show. And so it goes, until the next cycle begins.
