In the three days of the workshop, you will be guided through an exploration of the key ideas in Math, Chemistry, Physics and Biology. But unlike the traditional classroom, we will employ a radically different technique: The Domino Effect.

Instead of teaching you a particular topic in a subject (like bonding in chemistry), we will instead teach you the fundamental building blocks that make up the entirety of the subject. It’s a lot like arranging the entire subject as a series of dominos, and you’ll learn everything you need to topple the first block. Once that comes crashing down, all the other blocks will fall down as well.

This first principle based approach means that you’ll walk away with an unshakeable foundation in Math, Chemistry, Physics and Biology and any thing you learn in the future will take you half the time compared to your peers.
